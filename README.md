# Marcus Jaschen

👷 Keeping things running at MTB-News.de, Rennrad-News.de, eMTB-News.de and Nimms-Rad.de. Used the last 20+ years to accumulate lots of knowledge of PHP, web technologies, and on how to run Linux servers.

🚵🏻 Riding mountainbikes, roadbikes, and gravelbikes; not necessarily in that order.

🪑 Currently in the process of learning the art of woodworking.

📷️ Creating memories using cameras.
